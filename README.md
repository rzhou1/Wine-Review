### WineReview
Here we built a neural network model for multi-classification of wine varieties from Wine Reviews datasets. The model consists of a bidirectional LSTM encoder-decoder for textual representative embeddings and a prediction network for classification. Using only the learned embeddings as input, the model results in accuracy as high as 77%. By concatenating both the learned embeddings and external features as input, the model accuracy has been improved to 82%.

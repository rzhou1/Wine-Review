### WineReview
Here we introduce a neural network model for multi-classification of wine varieties from Wine Reviews datasets. The model consists of a bidirectional LSTM encoder-decoder for textual representative embeddings (here the wine review) and a prediction network for classification. Using only the learned embeddings as input, the model results in accuracy as high as 77% for 10-classes classification and well-balanced precision and recall. By concatenating both the learned embeddings and external features as input, the model accuracy has been improved to 82%.

##Introduction

  It is of great satisfaction for wine lover if he/she could identify its variety (and even winery and manufacturing year) by having a simple taste. Such practice could be possible for those who taste wines frequently from a wide range of varieties (as well as from a wide range of wineries) like professional wine tasters.
